### Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub page, where you will find much of what I do related to code, work, or projects. My main interests are web design and development, mobile application development, and retro video games. I'm always eager to learn new things, especially deep computer science concepts that let me combine my skills with real-world needs/problems. I hope to start spending more of my free time working on a few retro video game projects, so stay tuned for that.

## Projects that I am currently working on:

- TMA (The Modding Archive) <https://www.themoddingarchive.net/>

## Future projects:

- TBD (will add later, more incomming)
